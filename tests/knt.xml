<description>* Based on a shoujo manga by Shiina Karuho, serialised in Bessatsu Margaret.
Kuronuma Sawako is the perfect heroine... for a horror movie. With her jet-black hair, sinister smile and silent demeanor, she`s often mistaken for the haunting movie character Sadako. But behind her scary facade is a very misunderstood teenager. Too shy to fit in, all she wants to do is make some friends. But when a popular boy in class befriends her, she`s sure to make more than just that--she`s about to make some enemies too!

<name>Daily Life</name>
<description>The antics of the protagonists do not take place in some exotic setting or time, but in everyday life. When not "at the job" this means getting up in the morning, making meals, house cleaning, going shopping or out to eat, visiting the bath house or spa, leisure activities in the spare time, etc. The time "on the job" for students is School Life, for others working in their profession. Daily Life is basically a synonym for everything normal, repetitive, and trivial happening to your average person.</description>

<name>Coming of Age</name>
<description>In the strict sense the Coming of age describes a young person`s transition from adolescence to adulthood. In anime the term is used in a more general sense where the protagonists have to face a challenge, make an important decision in their life, take on responsibility, or learn a lesson, and by overcoming these obstacles they reach a higher level of maturity.</description>

<name>Super Deformed</name>
<description>A caricature style often seen in anime when the character shows extreme emotions, like fear, anger, happiness, surprise, or shame. Seen as cute, as part of humorous comedy. The character`s face suddenly turns into a simplified version, the body will usually also deform into that of a small child (oversized head, short limbs, extra-large tears).</description>

<name>Comedy</name>
<description>Anime whose central struggle causes hilarious results. These stories are built upon funny characters, situations and events. A comedy anime is laced with humour and sets out to provoke laughter from the audience.&#13;
&#13;
Japanese humour can be a bit strange to westerners, so if you`re new to this type of humour, just bear with it; it`ll most likely grow on you if you`re a fan of other kinds of comedy.</description>

<name>Manga</name>
<description>Manga is the lifeblood that drives the anime industry. Everything and its mother is based on manga. However! There are exceptions where the manga was not the basis for the anime.
It`s common practice to make manga adaptations of many popular anime, there`s a manga based on Evangelion, and two (one shounen and one shoujo) based on each of Escaflowne and Mahou Tsukai Tai. Also it`s quite common to release manga and anime versions of a story in parallel, for instance Nadesico and Shoujo Kakumei Utena.</description>

<description>The upper-secondary education (not compulsory in Japan) covers the grades ten, eleven, and twelve. The students are typically fifteen to eighteen years old.&#13;

Anime centre on High School settings predominately: Plot/story-wise the coming of age is of interest - the students are almost adults (their bodies have matured, see ecchi anime) with more earnest, real-life problems.</description>

<description>Someone confesses his/her love to someone else.
In a school setting it will usually be a boy confessing his love to a girl, though the more modern Japanese girls in anime will do quite a bit of confessing as well.
Since this is anime, girl/girl (shoujo ai) or boy/boy (shounen ai) confessions also happen.</description>

<name>Kurumizawa Ume</name>
<description>A girl who appears friendly and sweet to everyone around her, she has had a huge crush on Kazehaya since their first year of middle school. She dislikes her given name, Ume, because it sounds old-fashioned and prefers to be called her nickname, "Kurumi." She is extremely jealous of Sawako, which led her to spread fake rumours of Sawako`s only friends at the time, Yoshida and Yano, using Sawako`s name. Kurumi does not attend the same class as Sawako or Kazehaya.
She eventually confesses her love to Kazehaya, but receives an expected rejection. Because she is always surprised with Sawako`s naiveté, Kurumi is able to become friends with her, as well as a rival for Kazehaya`s affection. Following Kazehaya`s rejection, she becomes colder to her classmates, but is able to finally express her true feelings and personality.</description>

<description>Sawako is a shy yet honest girl who is in search of friendship, but her resemblance to horror film character Sadako and Sawako`s tendency to shy away from correcting people of misconceptions prevent her from doing so. Thanks to Kazehaya`s kind and open nature, she is able to gradually make friends, open up to her classmates, and talk to different people. She is grateful (and at first, worships) Kazehaya for giving her the opportunities to make close friends, which come to include Yano, Yoshida, Kazehaya and Ryuu.</description>

<description>Kazehaya is Sawako`s outgoing and friendly classmate. He is so popular that during middle school, so many girls liked him that they formed a "Kazehaya is Everyone`s" Alliance in order to maintain some level of peace among his admirers and more than half of these girls now attend the same high school. Kazehaya has held a long standing interest in Sawako and admits (though not to Sawako) that he likes her, unaware that she feels the same for him.</description>

<name>Yoshida Chizuru</name>
<description>Yoshida is another close friend of Sawako. She is the tomboy of the group. She has a soft spot for innocent mannered people, so she takes a near instant liking to Sawako. In Kurumi`s fake rumours it was passed around that she was a former Yankee, though Chizuru just takes the rumour as a means of scaring people off or as a joke for her friends. Chizuru is mostly only the slower side of things; she did not realise that Kazehaya liked Sawako until late in the series, after they started their second year of high school. 
She is a close childhood friend with Sanada Ryu, who is also the son of her favourite ramen shop`s owner, and went to the same middle school as Kazehaya. She has a crush on Ryu`s brother, Tooru.</description>

<name>Yano Ayane</name>
<description>Ayane is a close friend of Sawako. She is the arguably the most mature of the group and she has a boyfriend in college. In Kurumi`s fake rumours, it is said that Ayane has played more with more than 100 guys in middle school. In their current high school, it is being said that Yano and Yoshida have pretty much authority in the year group. Perceptive and intelligent, a trait of Ayane`s personality is that she gives just enough information to leave others wondering, thus forcing them to move forward. Although she is usually calm and collected, she is easily infuriated if someone hurts Sawako and does not hesitate to attack the one responsible she believes is responsible (frequently Kazehaya) with kicks and sharp words.</description>

<description>Ryuu is also member of Sawako`s group of friends. He is quiet most of the time and rarely talks, but still can communicate well with Sawako, as they both don`t talk much anyway. He is a close childhood friend with Chizuru and does not deny having feelings for her. Ryuu and Kazehaya became friends when they were on the baseball team during middle school.</description>

<description>The temporarily homeroom teacher for Sawako`s class, taking over when the previous homeroom teacher became sick during the summer holidays while Sawako was helping him. He is nicknamed Pin and always is called that way, except Sawako who obeys the formalities and still calls him Arai-sensei. Pin is a great fan of baseball as well as the school baseball team`s coach. He used to be part of Kazehaya`s father`s league team, so he has known Shouta since when he was young. A loud and eccentric man prone to believing the silliest things, Pin apparently enjoys interrupting people. He had nicknamed the puppy that Sawako and Kazehaya found by the river "Pedro Martinez" after the legendary baseball pitcher.</description>
