I originally started doing this with Python/Django, then moved on to Ruby/Sinatra.  I don't really want to do a long-term project in Ruby, though, and hosting Python's a bit of a PITA for a poor student like me.  Since my trend has been to see if I can host everything on GitHub, I decided to try building jellylorum completely client-side.

Well, ok, I lied a bit.  I'll use [OpenKeyval] for storing data, and probably [The Keymaster] to somewhat prevent vandalism.

Yes, it's a terrible strategy for the long-term, but I'm curious to see if I can do it.
